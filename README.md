# Movie and TV Show Search (an Alfred workflow)
An Alfred workflow to search for a movie or tv show and get a few ratings.

---

### Update (May, 2017)
Sadly, the OMDb API (on which this workflow relies) has gone private. Feel free to modify the code to add your own OMDb API key, but I will not be making any more updates to this workflow.
